<h1>Advanced ML Projects</h1>

<p>This repository contains mini projects on advanced Machine Learning topics, designed to showcase cutting-edge models and algorithms in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Each project is implemented with a focus on accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p>

<h2>Projects Included</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CNN Image Classification</strong>: A convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images with high accuracy. This project highlights how CNNs are used for image recognition and processing in a supervised learning setup.</li>
  <li><strong>LSTM</strong>: Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction. LSTMs excel at understanding sequential data, making them ideal for time series and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Generative AI</strong>: A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating new data samples. This project demonstrates how generative models can create new images, text, or even sound based on training data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project folder contains code, and datasets providing an in-depth look at how these advanced ML models are structured and implemented.</p>
